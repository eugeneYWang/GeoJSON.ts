# GeoJSON Parser TS

Turn your geo data info GeoJSON, inspired by @caseycesari/GeoJSON.js

Usually, an existed NPM package can just be used in TypeScript if a type definition file with the same name of that package is also installed. So why should I refactor that library into this typescript one? The reason is that the type definition named as GeoJSON has been occupied as the type definition of GeoJSON standard specification.
